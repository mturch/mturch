Cut from previous:

- 👋 Hello, my name is Michael Turchin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cryptocurrencies and algorithmic trading using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on multiple projects that I have in the works. Each one of these products are in the infancy stages of the Product Development Lifecycle. If you are interested in working on a project with me, with the intention of bringing it to market at a future date, then please reach out sooner rather than later so we can work out the finer details of our work arrangement so everything is already set up prior to our G2M launch date!
- 📫 You can reach me at Michael.I.Turchin@gmail.com, or please feel free to reach out to me via my personal/business mobile line at:  +1 (919) 341-9249.
